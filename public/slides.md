# Agentic AI

### From Concepts To Code

Note:
Welcome to this presentation on Agentic AI. We'll explore what makes AI systems truly autonomous, how they're built, and where the field is headed.

Note:
The DeepSeek R1 release triggered significant market cap losses across major software companies in late January 2026 — a sign of how seriously the market takes agentic AI disruption.

## The Agentic Race

Every major AI lab converging on the same conclusion: **agents that do work.**

## Why SaaS Is Being Repriced

<div class="path-compare">
<div class="path-item">
<div class="path-label">The Old Model</div>
<div class="path-flow">Buy SaaS → Pay per seat → Add modules → Pay more → Renew annually</div>
<div class="path-result">Value = access to software. Revenue grows with headcount.</div>
</div>
<div class="path-item path-highlight">
<div class="path-label">The New Model</div>
<div class="path-flow">AI agent connects to system of record → Pulls data → Executes workflow → Delivers outcome</div>
<div class="path-result">Value = outcomes delivered. Revenue decoupled from headcount.</div>
</div>
</div>

<hr>

**The math:** 10 AI agents do the work of 100 people → you need 10 seats, not 100. **90% seat revenue reduction** for the same output.

Note:
This is the core economic shift that's repricing the entire industry.

---

<!-- .slide: class="compact-slide" -->

## The Nuanced View

This isn't "SaaS is dead." It's more precise than that.

<div class="numbered-cards two-col">

<div class="card-title">Budget Starvation</div>
<div class="card-body">AI isn't eating the product. It's eating the budget. Every AI dollar is a dollar not going to SaaS.</div>
</div>
</div>

Note:
Understanding the nuance helps us see where the opportunities actually are.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#000000" class="dark-slide" -->

The software industry just got repriced because the market believes companies can now build custom, fit-for-purpose tools **faster and cheaper** than they can buy off-the-shelf software.

If that's true for Wall Street...

### what does it mean for us?

Note:
This is the transition from market analysis to our own situation.

## What Worked (And What Broke)

<div class="path-compare">
<div class="path-item">
<div class="path-label">What Worked</div>
<div class="path-flow">
• We understood our workflows intimately<br>
• We knew what data mattered and what was noise<br>
• We built tools that matched how the work actually happened<br>
• And people used them — because they were theirs
</div>
</div>
<div class="path-item">
<div class="path-label">What Broke</div>
<div class="path-flow">
• Fifteen apps became fifteen maintenance burdens<br>
• Technology evolved and the platforms didn't<br>
• Replatforming became a conversation that never ended<br>
• The debt accumulated faster than we could pay it down
</div>
</div>
</div>

Note:
The history of our internal tools contains both the successes and the warnings.

---

## Then Came Centralization

**Standardization**

The need for consistency, security, data governance, and cross-business-unit reporting drove centralization of technology decisions.

The intent was sound.

But something got lost.

Note:
This isn't about blame — it's about understanding the dynamics that led to our current situation.

---

<!-- .slide: class="compact-slide" -->

## A Building Company with an Industrial Problem

Technology decisions shaped by the building sector majority.
Industrial needs are structural edge cases.

<div class="path-compare">
<div class="path-item">
<div class="path-label">Building Sector</div>
<div class="path-flow">
• Tenant improvements<br>
• Concrete pours<br>
• Curtain walls<br>
• Standard project lifecycle
</div>
</div>
<div class="path-item path-highlight">
<div class="path-label">Industrial</div>
<div class="path-flow">
• Pipe fabrication<br>
• Modular assembly<br>
• Heavy lifts & turnarounds<br>
• Every project is unique
</div>
</div>
</div>

Note:
The majority rules in enterprise software decisions, and we're not the majority.

---

<!-- .slide: class="compact-slide" -->

## The Operating Model Problem

> "Define your operating model first. Then build systems to support it."
> — Weill & Ross, *IT Savvy*

**The Unify-First Pattern**

1. "Let's standardize our processes across all BUs first."
2. Select a COTS platform that fits the unified model.
3. Configure to the majority use case — building sector.
4. Industrial gets the leftover configuration.
5. The 80% that ships doesn't include our 20% that matters.

**Result:** we adopt tools designed for someone else's workflows and wonder why utilization is low.

Note:
The operating model framework helps explain why centralized IT decisions often miss industrial needs.

---

<!-- .slide: class="compact-slide" -->

## The 80% App

Every COTS platform promises coverage. Here's what actually arrives.

Note:
Then the platform shows low utilization and the next review asks: "Why aren't people using the tool?"

## The Best-of-Breed Paradox

> McKinsey (2017): Construction ranks second-to-last in digitization across all industries — ahead of only agriculture and hunting.

<div class="path-compare">
<div class="path-item">
<div class="path-label">The argument for COTS</div>
<div class="path-flow">
• Vendors serve thousands of companies across sectors<br>
• They distill cross-industry best practices into product<br>
• You inherit R&D investment you could never fund alone
</div>
</div>
<div class="path-item">
<div class="path-label">Why it breaks for us</div>
<div class="path-flow">
• Those "best practices" come from office-based, repetitive, standardized workflows<br>
• Construction is field-based, variable, project-specific, physical<br>
• The vendor's 10,000 customers taught them what we <em>don't</em> need
</div>
</div>
</div>

Note:
The paradox: the very thing that makes COTS "best of breed" — learning from thousands of customers — is what makes it worst-fit for an industry those customers don't resemble.

## The Relationship with Corporate BT

This isn't a blame slide. It's a proximity problem.

<div class="path-compare">
<div class="path-item">
<div class="path-label">Corporate BT optimizes for</div>
<div class="path-flow">

<div class="path-flow">
• Speed<br>
• Field-readiness<br>
• Construction-specific workflows<br>
• Tools that match the actual work

</div>
</div>

**The distance between enterprise optimization and job-site reality is where utilization goes to die.**

Note:
Both sides have legitimate priorities. The challenge is bridging the gap.

</div>

**Built by Industrial people. Not vendors. Not BT. Not a dev team.**

Note:
These four applications prove we can build what we need when given the opportunity.

---

<!-- .slide: class="compact-slide" -->

## Experiments: Proving What's Possible

<div class="card-title">Quantum</div>
<div class="card-body">Computer vision works on construction drawings — AI-powered takeoff automation. Reads piping isos, cable tray, electrical, structural steel</div>
</div>
</div>

**All seven — four apps, three experiments — prototyped by domain experts, not developers.**

Note:
Each experiment proved a specific capability that vendors said wasn't possible.

---

## So What Changed?

- Years of domain expertise in industrial construction
- A clear understanding of what tools we need and why
- A track record of building things that work — when we're allowed to

<hr>

And now: **the tools finally caught up.**

Note:
This is the pivot point in the narrative.

<div class="path-item">
<div class="path-label">Before (2024)</div>
<div class="path-flow">
• Hire developers<br>
• 6-month timeline<br>

</div>
</div>
<div class="path-item path-highlight">
<div class="path-label">Now (2026)</div>
<div class="path-flow">

• Prototype in hours<br>
• Iterate in days<br>
• Near-zero marginal cost<br>
• The person who needs it builds it
</div>
</div>
</div>

**The barrier is no longer the cost of development. It's understanding the problem.**

That's what Industrial has.

Note:
The economics have fundamentally shifted in favor of domain expertise.
