## The Agentic Race

Every major AI lab converging on the same conclusion: **agents that do work.**

## The Vocabulary Shift

<PathCompare>
  <PathItem label="Feb 2025" title='"Vibe Coding"'>
    <template #flow>
      Describe what you want. AI writes the code. You don't look at the diffs. "Fully give in to the vibes."
    </template>
    <template #result>
      Collins Dictionary Word of the Year 2025. iOS app releases up 60% YoY.
    </template>
  </PathItem>
  <PathItem label="Feb 2026" title='"Agentic Engineering"' highlight>
    <template #flow>
      AI agents write code themselves. Humans set goals and provide oversight. "Orchestrating a fleet of autonomous agents."
    </template>
    <template #result>
      The human role is now architectural.

  </PathItem>
</PathCompare>

## Why SaaS Is Being Repriced

<PathCompare>
  <PathItem label="The Old Model">
    <template #flow>
      Buy SaaS → Pay per seat → Add modules → Pay more → Renew annually
    </template>
    <template #result>
      Value = access to software. Revenue grows with headcount.
    </template>
  </PathItem>
  <PathItem label="The New Model" highlight>
    <template #flow>
      AI agent connects to system of record → Pulls data → Executes workflow → Delivers outcome
    </template>
    <template #result>
      Value = outcomes delivered. Revenue decoupled from headcount.
    </template>
  </PathItem>
</PathCompare>

<div class="border-t border-gray-700 my-6"></div>

**The math:** 10 AI agents do the work of 100 people → you need 10 seats, not 100. **90% seat revenue reduction** for the same output.

<!--
This is the core economic shift that's repricing the entire industry.
-->

---
class: compact-slide
---

## The Nuanced View

This isn't "SaaS is dead." It's more precise than that.

<NumberedCards :cols="2">
  <Card number="01" title="Systems of Record">
    Nobody's replacing their ERP with a chatbot. You still need CRM, ERP, project controls.
  </Card>
  <Card number="02" title="Application Layer">
    Dashboards, forms, workflows, reports — can now be generated on demand, tailored to your work.
  </Card>
  <Card number="03" title="Wrapper Stack">
    Companies packaging AI models with a nice UI are now competing with the model providers themselves.
  </Card>
  <Card number="04" title="Budget Starvation">
    AI isn't eating the product. It's eating the budget. Every AI dollar is a dollar not going to SaaS.
  </Card>
</NumberedCards>

<!--
Understanding the nuance helps us see where the opportunities actually are.
-->

---
layout: center
class: text-center
background: black

The software industry just got repriced because the market believes companies can now build custom, fit-for-purpose tools **faster and cheaper** than they can buy off-the-shelf software.

If that's true for Wall Street...

### what does it mean for us?

This is the transition from market analysis to our own situation.

## What Worked (And What Broke)

<PathCompare>
  <PathItem label="What Worked">
    <template #flow>
      • We understood our workflows intimately<br>
      • We knew what data mattered and what was noise<br>
      • We built tools that matched how the work actually happened<br>
      • And people used them — because they were theirs
    </template>
  </PathItem>
  <PathItem label="What Broke">
    <template #flow>
      • Fifteen apps became fifteen maintenance burdens<br>
      • Technology evolved and the platforms didn't<br>
      • Replatforming became a conversation that never ended<br>
      • The debt accumulated faster than we could pay it down
    </template>
  </PathItem>
</PathCompare>

<!--
The history of our internal tools contains both the successes and the warnings.
-->

---

## Then Came Centralization

**Standardization**

The need for consistency, security, data governance, and cross-business-unit reporting drove centralization of technology decisions.

The intent was sound.

But something got lost.

<!--
This isn't about blame — it's about understanding the dynamics that led to our current situation.
-->

---
class: compact-slide

## A Building Company with an Industrial Problem

Technology decisions shaped by the building sector majority.
Industrial needs are structural edge cases.

<PathCompare>
  <PathItem label="Building Sector">
    <template #flow>
      • Tenant improvements<br>
      • Concrete pours<br>
      • Curtain walls<br>
      • Standard project lifecycle
    </template>
  </PathItem>
  <PathItem label="Industrial" highlight>
    <template #flow>
      • Pipe fabrication<br>
      • Modular assembly<br>
      • Heavy lifts & turnarounds<br>
      • Every project is unique
    </template>
  </PathItem>
</PathCompare>

<!--
The majority rules in enterprise software decisions, and we're not the majority.

class: compact-slide

## The Operating Model Problem

> "Define your operating model first. Then build systems to support it."
> — Weill & Ross, *IT Savvy*

**The Unify-First Pattern**

1. "Let's standardize our processes across all BUs first."
2. Select a COTS platform that fits the unified model.
3. Configure to the majority use case — building sector.
4. Industrial gets the leftover configuration.
5. The 80% that ships doesn't include our 20% that matters.

**Result:** we adopt tools designed for someone else's workflows and wonder why utilization is low.

<!--
The operating model framework helps explain why centralized IT decisions often miss industrial needs.
-->

---
class: compact-slide
---

## The 80% App

Every COTS platform promises coverage. Here's what actually arrives.

<StatRow>
  <StatItem value="80%" label="Generic features" />
  <StatItem value="20%" label="Missing — where your work lives" />
</StatRow>

<NumberedCards :cols="3">

  <Card number="02" title="Welding">Joint integrity and weld tracking</Card>
  <Card number="03" title="Fabrication">Shop floor telemetry</Card>
  <Card number="04" title="Heavy Lift">Planning with load charts</Card>
  <Card number="05" title="Completions">Systems turnover sequences</Card>
  <Card number="06" title="Scaffold">Estimating with material tracking</Card>
</NumberedCards>

<!--
Then the platform shows low utilization and the next review asks: "Why aren't people using the tool?"

## The Best-of-Breed Paradox

> McKinsey (2017): Construction ranks second-to-last in digitization across all industries — ahead of only agriculture and hunting.

<PathCompare>
  <PathItem label="The argument for COTS">
    <template #flow>
      • Vendors serve thousands of companies across sectors<br>
      • They distill cross-industry best practices into product<br>
      • You inherit R&D investment you could never fund alone
    </template>
  </PathItem>
  <PathItem label="Why it breaks for us">
    <template #flow>
      • Those "best practices" come from office-based, repetitive, standardized workflows<br>
      • Construction is field-based, variable, project-specific, physical<br>
      • The vendor's 10,000 customers taught them what we <em>don't</em> need
    </template>
  </PathItem>
</PathCompare>

<!--
The paradox: the very thing that makes COTS "best of breed" — learning from thousands of customers — is what makes it worst-fit for an industry those customers don't resemble.

## The Cost of Misfit

<NumberedCards :cols="2">
  <Card number="01" title="Unused Features">
    We pay for features nobody asked for
  </Card>
  <Card number="02" title="Mismatched Training">
    We train people on workflows that don't match their work
  </Card>
  <Card number="03" title="Shadow Systems">
    Teams build workarounds — spreadsheets, side systems, tribal knowledge
  </Card>
  <Card number="04" title="Tool Avoidance">
    The "official" tool becomes the tool people avoid
  </Card>
</NumberedCards>

## The Relationship with Corporate BT

This isn't a blame slide. It's a proximity problem.

<PathCompare>
  <PathItem label="Corporate BT optimizes for">
    <template #flow>
      • Governance<br>
      • Security<br>
      • Scalability<br>
      • Cross-BU consistency
    </template>
  </PathItem>
  <PathItem label="Industrial needs" highlight>
    <template #flow>
      • Speed<br>
      • Field-readiness<br>
      • Construction-specific workflows<br>
      • Tools that match the actual work
    </template>
  </PathItem>
</PathCompare>

**The distance between enterprise optimization and job-site reality is where utilization goes to die.**

<!--
Both sides have legitimate priorities. The challenge is bridging the gap.

## What We've Already Built

<NumberedCards :cols="2">
  <Card number="01" title="Pulse">
    Meeting minutes & action tracking. Recognizes series vs. standalone meetings. Cross-meeting action tracking.
  </Card>
  <Card number="02" title="Pursu">
    Estimating management. Bid tracking, team workload & capacity. "Every estimate, pursued to completion."
  </Card>
  <Card number="03" title="Fabrik">
    Pipe spool fabrication. Tablet-first shop floor interface. Passive labor measurement through interaction telemetry.
  </Card>
  <Card number="04" title="Conduit">
    Content management & editorial planning. Flow-themed brand system. Full comms pipeline from ideation to delivery.
  </Card>
</NumberedCards>

**Built by Industrial people. Not vendors. Not BT. Not a dev team.**

<!--
These four applications prove we can build what we need when given the opportunity.
-->

---
class: compact-slide

## Experiments: Proving What's Possible

<NumberedCards :cols="1">
  <Card number="01" title="ContractLens">
    AI can parse construction contracts — flags indemnity, liquidated damages, scope exclusions, change orders against configurable risk playbook
  </Card>
  <Card number="02" title="TradeSchool">
    Legacy tools can be modernized in days — training & competency management, cert tracking, gap analysis, expiry alerts
  </Card>
  <Card number="03" title="Quantum">
    Computer vision works on construction drawings — AI-powered takeoff automation. Reads piping isos, cable tray, electrical, structural steel
  </Card>
</NumberedCards>

**All seven — four apps, three experiments — prototyped by domain experts, not developers.**

<!--
Each experiment proved a specific capability that vendors said wasn't possible.
-->

---

## So What Changed?

- Years of domain expertise in industrial construction
- A clear understanding of what tools we need and why
- A track record of building things that work — when we're allowed to

<div class="border-t border-gray-700 my-6"></div>

And now: **the tools finally caught up.**

## The Economics Flipped

<PathCompare>
  <PathItem label="Before (2024)">
    <template #flow>
      • Hire developers<br>
      • 6-month timeline<br>
      • $200K+ investment<br>
      • Ongoing maintenance burden<br>
      • IT governance review<br>
      • Maybe it ships
    </template>
  </PathItem>
  <PathItem label="Now (2026)" highlight>
    <template #flow>
      • Domain expert + agentic tool<br>
      • Prototype in hours<br>
      • Iterate in days<br>
      • Near-zero marginal cost<br>
      • The person who needs it builds it
    </template>
  </PathItem>
</PathCompare>

**The barrier is no longer the cost of development. It's understanding the problem.**

That's what Industrial has.

<!--
The economics have fundamentally shifted in favor of domain expertise.

### "We're not a software company."

## That's exactly the point.

<StatRow>
  <StatItem value="$XX M" label="Spent annually on software" />
  <StatItem value="~300" label="People employed to manage it" />

**We're already paying software-company prices.**
